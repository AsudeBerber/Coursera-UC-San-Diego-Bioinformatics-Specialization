    "After we do that our total number of actual outcomes is augmented by 4 (the \"extrapolated\" ones count too). So each actual outcome is now one outcome over 5 + 4 outcomes = 9 outcomes. And that's the new number we must use as a denominator to calculate the probability for a possible outcome.  When we apply it, we obtain the figure in this lesson, on the right.\n",

    "- 1 is for for the first iteration there is only one line in the dna_matrix for which Count() and Profile() are computed,\n",
    "- 4 is for the application for Laplace's rule as we just saw, we add 4 because of it to the denominator.\n",
